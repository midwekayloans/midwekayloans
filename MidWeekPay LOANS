MidWeekPay LOANS

Pew also continues to encourage adoption of a definition of affordable payments that would shield 95 percent of a borrowerâ€™s paycheck from creditors by limiting payments to 5 percent of income. For example, a customer making $2,500 a month ($30,000 a year) would repay a loan in monthly installments of no more than $125. Borrowers report that they can afford such payments, and our extensive research supports their assessments. This research-based standard would ensure affordable payments while also creating a simple regulatory compliance mechanism that would allow banks and credit unions to profitably offer small installment credit to their customers at prices six times lower than payday loans.
