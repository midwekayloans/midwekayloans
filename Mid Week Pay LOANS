State legislators should rein in high-cost payday installment loans
The new rule is likely to accelerate the transition among payday and auto title lenders to high-cost installment loans. These lenders already issue such loans in half the states, typically at annual percentage rates of 300 to 400 percent, and the Mid Week Pay LOANS rule will not prevent them from doing so. Pew continues to recommend that legislators in these states reform their laws to rein in excessive prices, durations, and unaffordable payments and ensure that payday installment loans have lower costs and safer terms.
